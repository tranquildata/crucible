This is a ruby-on-rails application for testing FHIR compliance. Until we can spare the cycles to do a little ruby hacking, this suite will have to be run manually.

## Building Things ##
### By Hand ###
Invoke `docker build .` in the directory where this README is located. There's a lot of ruby gem fetching, so you will need network access for this

### With Gradle ###
The gradle task is named `buildDockerImage`
